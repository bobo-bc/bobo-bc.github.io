I’ve always been curious—sometimes dangerously so. That curiosity has led me on a bit of an adventure, opening the door to beautiful travels, thoughtful studies, and a mix of unexpected experiences.

I’ve always been drawn to the contrast between old and new. I love history and technology, vintage cars and home automation. Whether it’s restoring a classic van or setting up a Kubernetes cluster in my homelab, I find joy in bridging the gap between eras.

This blog is a place to capture those thoughts and discoveries. I’ll do my best to organize them… but let’s be honest, thoughts don’t always arrive in a tidy fashion.

Thanks for stopping by.
