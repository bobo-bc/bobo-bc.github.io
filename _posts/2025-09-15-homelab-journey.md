## Why homelab
I have spent most of my working life working in IT. Technology moves fast so the only way I found to keep fresh is to build a lab and play with the new technologies in order to learn and make mistakes in order that you can become truely functional in the job. 

My first homelab was an old, retired corporate labtop that I installed an early debian liniux on and turned it into a sendmail server. At that time I did not know linux but was a MCSE administrator for exchange. It was hard but very rewarding. 

Eventually I jumped on the Raspberry pi movement and build home servers and automation and in so doing stumbled into docker. It was smart and scalable and I kept pushing my raspberry pi's to their limit.

I have now retired from the "day job" and am serious about my homelab. I run proxmox and tool around with docker swarm and now kubernetes. I have kept my code in gihub so I can keep it safe and play with deployments and have a few quick notes on the wiki pages. This blog is my attempt to organize and put and collect those thoughts.
