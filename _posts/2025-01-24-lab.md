I am an old school nerd who has had a homelab before it was cool. One of my first experiments was building a sendmail server on an old laptop using only the command line interface -cli so I could get into how linux worked. A lot has changed in 25 years since that first exercise. I spend a few years working off raspberry pi platform learning hosting and dabbling in docker.

As of late I have been interested in clustering and that involved too many steps /physical steps the experimenting on pis so I took the big leap and shifted to Proxmox and have not looked back.

The aim of this site is to jot down some notes as I experiment resulting in hosting my own stuff and using what I host.
