After months of stacking gear like a game of Tetris on my shelf, I finally bit the bullet and bought a GeeekPi 4U Server Cabinet to bring some order to my homelab. My setup isn’t huge—just a **Minisforum MS-01**, a **UniFi Gateway Ultra**, a **Netgear PoE switch, **and a couple of **external m2 sata drives. **—but once you start adding VMs, access points, and Docker containers, things can get messy fast.

In this post, I’ll walk through why I decided to rack my gear and why organizing your homelab isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about stability, efficiency, and peace of mind.

## **The Reality of a Growing Homelab**

Like a lot of folks who tinker with Proxmox, K3s clusters, and Raspberry Pis, my homelab started small. One device led to another. A Pi became a server. A switch became PoE. And soon enough I was managing:

- Virtual machines in Proxmox (on the MS-01)
- Containerized apps in Docker Swarm and K3s
- Longhorn and NFS shares
- Networking gear for VLANs and external tunnels

The problem? Everything was **loose**, **cabled across open shelves**, and **half-hidden behind books**. Even with labeling and careful power management, troubleshooting was becoming a chore.

## ** Enter theDeskPi Rack**

I grabbed a **DeskPi Rack** specifically for homelab setups like mine. It’s designed to house multiple SBCs or mini PCs while still being rack-compatible. It doesn’t require a full server rack, heck mine is 10" tall,  but lets you mount gear cleanly—perfect for small labs.

With the DeskPi rack:

- The **Minisforum MS-01** got securely mounted with airflow clearance.
- The **UniFi Gateway Ultra** and **Netgear PoE switch** finally had designated spots.
- Cables are neatly routed and labeled—no more guesswork.
- Everything powers on from a single PDU with surge protection.

## ** Why You Should Organize Your Homelab**

### **Easier Troubleshooting**

When something breaks (and it always will), the last thing you want is to fish through a pile of wires. With a rack, I can trace cables instantly and isolate hardware without crawling behind furniture.

### **Better Cooling and Airflow**

Stacked gear gets hot. Rack-mounting leaves space for ventilation and airflow. Since organizing, my MS-01 runs cooler, and the UniFi Gateway has better passive airflow.

### **Cleaner Cable Management**

Racks force discipline. I added velcro straps, cable guides, and labeled everything. Now I know which port does what at a glance—whether it’s a VLAN trunk, a NAS mount, or a K3s node.

### **More Scalable**

Want to add another node? A PiKVM? A backup NAS? With an organized rack, I just make space and plug it in—no need to rethink the entire layout.

### **You’ll Actually Enjoy It More**

There’s something deeply satisfying about a clean setup. It turns a hobby into a *platform*. You’ll find yourself more inclined to test things, update services, and write blog posts (like this one ).

## **Final Thoughts**

Organizing your homelab isn’t just for folks with full server rooms. Even a modest home setup benefits from some structure. The DeskPi rack gave me a solid foundation—compact, tidy, and ready to scale.

If you’ve been putting off the cleanup, consider this your nudge. Your future self (and your cables) will thank you.
