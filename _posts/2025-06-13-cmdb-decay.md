**The Critical Work Begins After Go-Live**

---

Implementing ServiceNow is a major milestone — especially when a brand-new CMDB has been stood up. During the implementation, focus is usually placed on initial population: running discovery tools, uploading spreadsheets, and getting just enough data to satisfy Incident, Change, or Problem processes.

But here’s the catch: the CMDB you have at **Day One** isn’t what makes or breaks your ITSM maturity.

It’s what you do on **Day Two and beyond** that determines whether the CMDB becomes a trusted operational source — or yet another abandoned inventory list.

---

### **Why CMDB Decay Happens**

Most post-implementation issues with CMDBs fall into two categories:

- **Lack of accountability**: No one owns the lifecycle of the data.
- **Missing governance**: No process exists for validating, updating, or retiring CIs.

As the CMDB becomes stale, users stop trusting it. Once that happens, the value it brings to ServiceNow — accurate change impact analysis, relationship mapping, service health insights — quickly disappears.

## **Start with the Right Foundation: CSDM Guidance**

Before you move forward with maintenance, make sure your CMDB is built on a sustainable model.

ServiceNow’s **Common Service Data Model (CSDM)** provides the structure you need to:

- Classify data consistently
- Map technical services to business capabilities
- Use out-of-the-box tables and relationships as intended

Even if your initial implementation was light on CSDM alignment, Day Two is the right time to start realigning with best practices. Don’t try to build a custom model that will be hard to support later.

## **Day Two Activities That Keep Your CMDB Alive**

If you’ve just launched ServiceNow, here’s what to focus on to keep your CMDB reliable and sustainable:

### **Establish Ownership**

Every CI class — and ideally every critical CI — should have an assigned owner or steward. Use roles and groups in ServiceNow to formalize this accountability.

### **Define and Enforce Lifecycle States**

Work with teams to define stages like *planned*, *in use*, *retired*, and *disposed*. Automate transitions using workflows or lifecycle policies wherever possible.

### **Validate the Data**

Set up dictionary constraints, reference fields, and data policies to limit bad input. Build reports that highlight incomplete, duplicated, or inconsistent records.

### **Set Up CMDB Health Dashboards**

Use CMDB Health Scores in ServiceNow to track completeness, correctness, and compliance. Schedule reviews and build ownership into operational routines.

### **Integrate with ITSM Outcomes**

Show value by tying clean CMDB data to measurable improvements:

- Faster incident resolution through service mapping
- More accurate change impact analysis
- Improved root cause analysis in Problem Management

When stakeholders see the connection between CMDB data and ITSM performance, they’re more likely to invest in maintaining it.

## **Final Thought: Don’t Wait for Decay to Happen**

A CMDB is never “done.” It’s a living system that requires structure, ownership, and regular review to stay healthy. The good news is that ServiceNow gives you the tools to automate much of this — if you adopt a disciplined Day Two approach.

Don’t let all that implementation effort go to waste. Start small, align with CSDM, assign responsibility, and treat your CMDB like the operational asset it was meant to be.
