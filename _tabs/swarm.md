## Introduction

Docker Swarm is a native clustering solution for Docker. It lets you run multiple Docker daemons on multiple machines and manage them as a single virtual system. You can scale services up and down, and achieve high availability.

## Setting Up the OS

I recommend **DietPi** for minimal setup:

- Lightweight, fast, and preconfigured for small clusters
- Works well with Docker
- Minimal manual configuration needed

## Deploying Docker Swarm

1. Initialize the swarm on your manager node:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>
