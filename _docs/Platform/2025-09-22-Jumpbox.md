I cannot express enough the need for a jumpbox. I use dietpi and have
included desktop in case I am looking for that experience but mostly
just use the cli. 

To prep the jumpbox you need to at least copy the config yaml from your
kubernetes master to manage it. use this from the jump box:

``` plaintext
ssh k3s1 "sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml" > ~/.kube/config
```

 

then to change the IP to the vip or primary master IP do this

``` plaintext
sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/10.0.0.10/' ~/.kube/config
```

 

 

now you can 

``` plaintext
kubeconfig get nodes -o wide
```

 

to see your cluster.

 

to make life easier you can add your public key to cloud-init on
Proxmox. 

on your jumpbox

``` plaintext
cat /home/bobo/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

 

 

 and on your mac

``` plaintext
sudo cat /Users/steven/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

 

Now,  the pro move is to add a config file under .ssh/config with the
content formatted like this

``` plaintext
Host k3s1
  HostName 10.0.0.11
  User bobo

Host k3s2
  HostName 10.0.0.12
  User bobo

Host k3s3
  HostName 10.0.0.13
  User bobo

Host worker1
  HostName 10.0.0.14
  User bobo

Host worker2
  HostName 10.0.0.15
  User bobo

Host worker3
  HostName 10.0.0.16
  User bobo
```

 

if you need to add ssh key manually,

``` plaintext
ssh-copy-id bobo@k3s1
```
